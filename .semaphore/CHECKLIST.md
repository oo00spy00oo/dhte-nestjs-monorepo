# Semaphore CI Optimization Checklist

## Pre-Migration Checklist

### 1. Backup and Documentation

- [ ] Backup current `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` configuration
- [ ] Document current pipeline execution times for comparison
- [ ] Identify critical dependencies and integration points
- [ ] Review current secret management approach

### 2. Environment Preparation

- [ ] Set up Nx Cloud account (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Verify Docker registry access and credentials
- [ ] Confirm GraphQL Hive token validity
- [ ] Test SonarQube connection and token

### 3. Secret Configuration

- [ ] Configure `Docker Registry` secret in Semaphore
  - [ ] `DOCKER_USERNAME`
  - [ ] `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
- [ ] Configure `ZMA Hive` secret in Semaphore
  - [ ] `HIVE_TOKEN`
- [ ] Configure `Sonar Token` secret in Semaphore
  - [ ] `SONAR_TOKEN`
- [ ] Configure `Security Notifications` secret in Semaphore
  - [ ] `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
  - [ ] `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
  - [ ] `TELEGRAM_TRIVY_THREAD_ID`
  - [ ] `TELEGRAM_SECRET_THREAD_ID`
  - [ ] `TELEGRAM_MALWARE_THREAD_ID`

## Migration Checklist

### 1. Configuration Update

- [ ] Replace `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` with optimized version
- [ ] Add Nx Cloud token to environment variables (if using)
- [ ] Update any project-specific configurations
- [ ] Verify all secret references are correctly mapped

### 2. Testing Strategy

- [ ] Create test branch for pipeline validation
- [ ] Test with single project change
- [ ] Test with multiple project changes
- [ ] Test with no affected projects
- [ ] Validate error handling scenarios

### 3. Performance Validation

- [ ] Monitor first few pipeline executions
- [ ] Compare execution times with baseline
- [ ] Verify parallel job execution
- [ ] Check cache hit rates

## Post-Migration Checklist

### 1. Immediate Monitoring (Week 1)

- [ ] Daily pipeline execution time tracking
- [ ] Monitor error rates and patterns
- [ ] Verify security scan completion
- [ ] Check artifact generation and sharing
- [ ] Validate Telegram notifications (if configured)

### 2. Performance Optimization (Week 2-4)

- [ ] Analyze bottlenecks in parallel stages
- [ ] Optimize cache strategies based on patterns
- [ ] Fine-tune parallel job counts (`--parallel=N`)
- [ ] Monitor resource utilization and costs

### 3. Security Validation

- [ ] Confirm all security scans complete successfully
- [ ] Verify container vulnerability reports
- [ ] Test secret scanning effectiveness
- [ ] Validate malware detection capabilities

## Optional Enhancements

### 1. PR Security Pipeline

- [ ] Deploy `pr-security.yml` as separate pipeline
- [ ] Configure PR trigger conditions
- [ ] Test security scanning on sample PR
- [ ] Validate security report generation

### 2. Advanced Monitoring

- [ ] Set up pipeline metrics dashboard
- [ ] Configure alerting for pipeline failures
- [ ] Implement cost tracking for CI resources
- [ ] Create developer feedback collection system

### 3. Further Optimizations

- [ ] Enable Nx Cloud distributed task execution
- [ ] Implement container layer caching
- [ ] Add incremental build strategies
- [ ] Configure dynamic parallelization

## Rollback Checklist

### Emergency Rollback

- [ ] Restore backup configuration
- [ ] Verify rollback pipeline execution
- [ ] Document issues encountered
- [ ] Plan improvement approach

### Partial Rollback Options

- [ ] Disable parallelization if resource issues occur
- [ ] Revert to basic caching if cache issues arise
- [ ] Remove Nx Cloud integration if connectivity problems
- [ ] Restore error masking if needed for stability

## Success Criteria

### Performance Metrics

- [ ] 50-60% reduction in total pipeline time
- [ ] > 70% cache hit rate achieved
- [ ] <5% pipeline failure rate
- [ ] Parallel job execution confirmed

### Security Metrics

- [ ] 100% security scan completion on main branch
- [ ] All container images scanned before deployment
- [ ] Security notifications working correctly
- [ ] No security regressions introduced

### Developer Experience

- [ ] Faster feedback loops for developers
- [ ] Clear failure messages and debugging info
- [ ] Reliable pipeline execution
- [ ] Improved deployment confidence

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly Tasks

- [ ] Review pipeline performance metrics
- [ ] Check for any recurring failures
- [ ] Monitor cache utilization patterns
- [ ] Update this checklist based on learnings

### Monthly Tasks

- [ ] Update base images and security tools
- [ ] Review and optimize parallel job configurations
- [ ] Analyze cost trends and optimization opportunities
- [ ] Gather developer feedback and pain points

### Quarterly Tasks

- [ ] Major dependency updates (Nx, Node.js, etc.)
- [ ] Security tool version updates
- [ ] Pipeline architecture review
- [ ] Performance benchmark comparison
